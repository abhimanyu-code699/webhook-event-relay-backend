# üöÄ Webhook Event Relay System (Backend)

The **Webhook Event Relay System** is a backend service built using **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma ORM**.  
It acts as a bridge between external services and client applications by **receiving, processing, and relaying webhook events** in real-time ‚Äî for example, job application updates on a candidate dashboard.

---

## üß† Overview

When an event occurs (e.g., a candidate applies for a job), the external system triggers a **webhook** to this backend.  
This service:
1. Receives and validates the webhook payload.
2. Stores the event in a **PostgreSQL** database using **Prisma**.
3. Relays the event to the appropriate client or service (e.g., via REST API, BullMQ).
4. Updates the event status and maintains a complete event log for reliability.
